In this code, I provided implements a comprehensive pipeline for evaluating and optimizing a Decision Tree Classifier for a binary classification task. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing: begin by loading a dataset from a CSV file and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and converting target labels to a binary format.

    Initial Model Training and Evaluation: I split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets and initializes a Decision Tree Classifier. Then I trained the classifier on the training data, and evaluated its performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, I visualized a confusion matrix to understand the classifier's performance in detail.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: I performed hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation and GridSearchCV to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the Decision Tree Classifier. I iterate through different hyperparameter values and evaluate each combination using cross-validation.

    Final Model Training and Evaluation: After finding the best hyperparameters, I created a new Decision Tree Classifier with the optimal settings. and I trained the classifier on the full training set, and evaluated the performance on the test set using the same metrics as before.

    Performance Comparison: Finally, I compares the performance metrics of the classifier before and after hyperparameter tuning. This comparison provides insights into the effectiveness of the tuning process in improving the classifier's performance.

Overall, in this pipeline I enables a systematic approach to evaluate and optimize the Decision Tree Classifier, ensuring that it achieves the best possible performance on the given dataset.
